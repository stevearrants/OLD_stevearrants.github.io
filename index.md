Hello! I’m Steve Arrants, a Vermont based technical writer and editor, content developer, and specialist in online documentation. Throughout my career I’ve investigated, researched, organized, and explained things in accessible and user-friendly ways. I’ve created documents used on the Space Shuttle. I’ve managed award-winning websites for a leading news site. I’ve helped companies both large and small bring their documentation online while reducing costs and shrinking schedules. I did have a link to a portfolio of samples, but I’ve found that someone else linked to them and tried to pass them off as her own. I’ve taken the links down. If you’d like to see samples, contact me through a link below.
